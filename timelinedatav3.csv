1700,,CT,Connecticut: 450 enslaved people,CT,"According to data compiled by Peter Hinks and made available by the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition at Yale University, there were approximately 450 enslaved peple in Connecticut in 1700. That estimate draws on data from historical statistics published by the US Bureau of the Census in 1961. According to Thomas Purvis’s Colonial America to 1763, 25,970 people lived in Connecticut at the time, meaning enslaved people made up less than 2% of the overall population of the colony.

1701,,SC,"South Carolina passes curfew law for black people, and merges its militas with slave patrols",SC,"According to an article in The William and Mary Quarterly, “the most radical” intervention of the 1701 South Carolinian “Act for the Better Ordering of Slaves” was the merging and creation of slave patrols with militias (or “constables”), enacted in order to rid the community of runaway slaves. This law gave constables the right to “impress” citizens of the town, essentially requiring townspeople to work alongside the merged militia and patrol to capture or aid in the capturing of runaway slaves. Fining citizens who refused to be impressed, and constables who neglected to perform this duty perpetuated a violent system requiring the searching of homes, as well as the seizing and public whipping of slaves, who were then labeled as runaways, sold off to town marshals, and returned to their masters.

1708,,CT,Connecticut passes law forbidding enslaved people from selling goods to whites,CT,"In the face of an increasingly heterogeneous economy that created an environment of self-sufficiency for people of all races and socioeconomic backgrounds, the colony of Connecticut feared that enslaved people would be inspired to use their businesses as sources of income and security to support themselves upon their escape from the ever-tightening grasp of enslavement. Ratified in 1708, the Act For The Punishment of Those Who Receive Payment from Negroes states that any free person who received goods, services, or trade with an enslaved black or Indigenous person, without the permission of their master, was to forfeit the goods, and, if they refused, to be punished by no more than 20 hits of a whip, while the offending vendor would be punished with no more than 30 hits. Facing the rising popularity of emancipation, this law was enacted to avoid the new social dynamic of white people paying black people to maintain the narrative of white superiority and capitalist greed.

The Lowcountry Digital History Initiative from the College of Charleston states that before 1710, enslaved Africans arriving in the South Carolina Lowcountry were less than 300, and by 1770, more than 3,000 were imported annually. By 1780 South Carolina was the only state in which the Black population exceeded the white at 53.9% according to the University of Maryland; enslaved people in South Carolina  were united by their shared port of entry and the black majority, establishing bonds through shared languages, kinship, and nationality.

The Gradual Emancipation Act “levelled a devastating blow” to slavery and managed to diminish the number of enslaved people in Connecticut “slowly but steadily” over the following years.

Menschel explains how the bill included language revealing the truth of the adverse effects slavery had on enslaved people, which was alarming to the legislature because they worried it would create conflict between the contradicting opinions of abolitionists and slaveholders, and they “sought to balance these interests”.  In other words, the 1784 bill “reflected the contingent nature of Connecticut’s support for abolition,” as the state’s gradual abolition laws didn’t necessarily mean that it supported antislavery.

Ironically, this boosted demand for cotton, especially by New England textile mills, as stated in William K.

The importation ban made no effort in changing the perspectives of Americans towards slavery, as seen through the increase of domestic sales of enslaved individuals and the illegal importation of at least 50,000 more slaves to the United States after 1808. This dependance on the domestic slave trade provided the basis for 19th century southern slavery, and enabled the institution’s continued existence.

As the founders of the Society believed that such action was a benevolent offer that will not only resolve the issue of the rising black population in America but also provide the long-desired freedom for black people, its wide acceptance during the time indicates a deep-rooted sense of racism and a continuation of colonialism. Many white abolitionists supported the Society as their goal was to remove the black population from America instead of removing slavery, while the black abolitionists reacted to it with hate and disdain.

For example, the 1818 Connecticut Constitution states the discriminatory qualifications for electors in Section 2 of Article VI,  “Every white male citizen of the United States who shall have gained a settlement in this state, attained the age of twenty-one years, [...] and have a freehold estate of the yearly value of seven dollars in this state.”, indirectly excluding African Americans, women, Native Americans, and non-English speakers."

The information drawn from a journal article written by The South Carolina Historical Society states that the act of 1820 was a part of a series of laws passed in order to reduce slaveholders’ rights to free enslaved people, and thus reduce the number of freedpeople.

1830,,CT,"Connecticut: 25 enslaved people, 8,000 free Blacks",CT,"From the mid-1780s to 1830, Connecticut legislators and vocal abolitionists of the time, such as Jonathan Edwards Jr. and Theodore Dwight, facilitated the emancipation of thousands of enslaved people, resulting in a majority of free black people and a smaller number of enslaved black people. After Connecticut legislation was passed in 1784 enabling children born from an enslaved mother to become free at the age of 25, a clear increase to more than 5,000 free black people appears roughly 25 years later, when the children become of age to claim their freedom. Of course, the self-emancipating efforts of enslaved people significantly contributed to this development. As black citizens continued advocating for rapid emancipation, according to US Census data, the number of enslaved people dropped to 97 by 1820 and 17 by 1840.  In 1832, there was only 1 enslaved person in Hartford County, where the Loomis and Chaffee families resided at the time. The freed people have accustomed to life beyond slavery, obtaining jobs such as tailors, dyers of cloth, mariners, tradesmen, and domestic workers.

The University, which was still a new institution, was reliant on the support of both the Northerners and Southerners; therefore it complied with the demands of the students in order to maintain the fortification of the white students. Charles B. Ray’s experience at Wesleyan University reveals that racism in Connecticut wasn’t minor as often assumed; rather, racism was still prominent at this time in Connecticut. Litwack, Leon F.

1832,,USA,"Textile companies make up 88 out of 106 American corporations valued at over $100,000. ",USA,"By 1832, 88 out of the 106 American corporations valued at over $100,000 were textile factories supported by both free labor in the north and exploited cotton from plantations in the south. These factories sourced their raw materials from slave plantations, which, according to American Yawp, increased their exports 150,000 bales in 1815 to 4,541,000 bales in 1859. Because of the unethical origins of these materials used, the clothing industry became silent supporters of the slavery practices in the United States. Scranton, Philip.

1833,,USA,"William Lloyd Garrison forms the American Anti-Slavery Society, the largest abolitionist society in the US",USA,"William Lloyd Garrison was a prominent advocate for the emancipation of enslaved people who, according to the data from the National Abolition Hall of Fame and Museum, created the largest abolitionist society in the United States – the American Anti- Slavery Society– with over 1,350 local chapters and 250,000 members. Garrison inspired many generations with his brave actions for equal rights for Black people, like setting fire to a copy of the U.S. Constitution because it permitted slavery, according to James Williford’s journal article, “The Agitator: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolitionists.” Moreover, he was also the founder of The Liberator, an anti-slavery newspaper, and he inspired young generations with his unrivaled example of personal journalism in the service of civic idealism for 35 years.

1836,,USA,"The U.S. House of Representatives bans discussion of slavery with its ""gag rule""",USA,"According to Scott R. Meinke, the “gag rule” of 1836 prevented and restricted any conversation in the House of Representatives that concerned the abolition of slavery and related matters. Due to this, the House of Representatives received countless petitions concerning the end of slavery. According to Meinke, the rule was recognized by President John Quincy Adams and other members of the Whig party; they believed the rule infringed on the ideas in the Declaration of Independence, and, due to this opposition in the House of Representatives, the “gag rule” was repealed in 1844.

1848,,CT,"Connecticut entirely abolishes slavery, the last New England State to do so, but requires race on marriage licenses and bans Black individuals from voting ",CT,"According to The Yale Law Journal by David Menschel, Connecticut chose a slower approach to pursue an equitable society while avoiding social unrest by passing the Gradual Abolition Act in 1784, manumitting the children of enslaved persons which freed the last Connecticut slave in 1848. Despite taking the first step towards racial equality, Connecticut held on to its past of discrimination and oppression by requiring citizens to state their race on marriage licenses, voting registration, and several other personal legal documents. Data presented by the Brennan Center for Justice suggests these laws led Connecticut to continue its practice of racial segregation into the Jim Crow era and even today.

According to the Library of Congress, three hundred thousand copies of the novel were sold in America in the year it was published, with an additional two million copies sold worldwide by 1857.

Sanford that Black individuals are not US citizens,USA,"According to general Supreme Court histories compiled by Oyez and Thirteen, Dred Scott, an enslaved person who resided in a free state and sued for freedom in 1856, had his case dismissed due to his lack of American citizenship. The court argued that since Scott was legally considered chattel, they could not deprive his owner John F. A. Sanford of his property, as it would go against the Fifth Amendment. According to “Black American vs. Citizenship: The Dred Scott Decision” by Gossie Harold Hudson, the court declared the Missouri Compromise to be unconstitutional, further galvanizing the abolition movement and spurring the end of the Antebellum period.

January for the South Carolina Historical Magazine, the South Carolina Association was formed in 1823 in reaction to the attempted insurrection by Denmark Vesey, a formerly enslaved man. Instantly popular amongst the public after its formation, the Association was an organization formed to relieve the concerns of Black resistance by enforcing stricter laws and was composed of many of the state’s prominent men, boasting nearly every important individual or family amongst its signatories. In hopes to cease the enslaved peoples’ “corruption” or outside exposure with freed Blacks, the Association pursued the prevention of “any free colored person from any part of the world ever entering again into the limits of the State of South Carolina, by land or water” (January, 196).

Many Americans viewed John Brown’s raid with disdain, but after Brown’s strategic prison letters and interviews, his public perception metamorphosed from one of a “portentous omen” to a “saint” and a “Christ-like martyr.” Brown’s raid, characterized as tactical self-sacrifice, further fueled antislavery rhetoric and America’s sectionalist North-South divide through his mythical status, catapulting abolitionist values to national prominence and influence.Trodd, Zoe. “John Brown’s Spirit: The Abolitionist Aesthetic of Emancipatory Martyrdom in Early Antilynching Protest Literature.” Journal of American Studies 49, no. 2 (2015): 305–21. http://www.jstor.org/stable/24485633."

In fact, of the 9,914 free Black residents of Charleston three-quarters identified as mulattoes, who could not provide documentation of emancipation as they were children of enslaved people. Four separate times, legislation burdened the free black community and looked to re-enslave them in effect. This included one bill that prevented Black people from working in the mechanical trade. Another bill imposed a tax on the community that was not imposed on the White people of Charleston. Failure or inability to pay would result in re-enslavement.

1861,,USA,The Civil War begins,USA,"As Paul Finkelman has written, the Civil War began in 1861, with one of the primary causes being the debate over slavery. South Carolina claimed the protections of slavery written into the Constitution were weakened by Northern state laws. South Carolina then left the Union with ten other states later following in their footsteps. The downfall of the Union and separation of the North and the South ultimately led to the beginnings of the Civil War.
