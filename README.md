# loomis-racial-history
Digital Humanities pieces exploring Loomis Chaffee's history with slavery (and hopefully more)

Future Loomis Interns, use this to house your code or to refer to what's already been done. This will hopefully evolve in the future, so reach out with any questions and feel from to tweak anything (just don't break things please)

2022 Timeline done by Ignacio Feged--> ignaciofeged@gmail.com

-Go for it and make it better, just note that changes in the active branches (currently just herokutest) will change the display on the server and the Loomis website

-Timeline created with the R packages timevis and shiny, then exported thru heroku

-Timeline with 2021 data is exported thru the herokutest branch and the R code before heroku can be found in the last summer folder under the main branch
